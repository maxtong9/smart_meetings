# SmartMeetings: Product Requirements Document
### Team Name: Meeting is Believing
Team Members: Maxton Ginier (Lead), Tuan Le, Jackson Li, Sarita Phoosopha, Christina Tao

## Introduction
### Problem
Meetings are crucial for any line of work. They are absolutely necessary for communication between colleagues about ideas, problems, roadblocks, etcâ€¦ However, repetition of discussions and materials from previous meetings are downfalls that cause present-day meetings to be very inefficient and leads to more unnecessary meetings. Other common problems in meetings are undistributed speaking time, downfalls of groupthink, members absence, and run on meetings.
### Innovation
This project will produce a tool that makes meetings more productive and collaborative by providing a more meaningful analysis of the meeting. This will be accomplished by displaying and maintaining specific scrum information to detect progress. The application will prompt pre-meeting questions about the type of meetings (stand-up, long board meetings, etc.) and the estimated/desired meeting time that the application will use to predict how the pacing and runtime of the meeting. Additionally, video analysis will be used to detect restless/anxious behaviors (e.g. fidgeting) to inform meeting participants that the meeting may be running too long.
### Core Advancement
Our project aims to solve this problem using machine learning technologies, primarily audio recognition and natural language processing tools to provide annotated transcript, note-taking, and automatic to-do list creation based on spoken keywords. The project also aims to track meetings progress and emotional sentiments of each member as they contribute to provide a well-rounded summary of the meetings.
### Background
The problem is currently being solved using audio transcription by various companies; however, the processing and analysis of the transcription is lacking. Most applications focus on having a simple transcription of the meeting afterwards, which catch absent members up when necessary, but does not access real-time information that can benefit current, as well as the future meetings.
